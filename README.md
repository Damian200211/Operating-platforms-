# ðŸ“„ The Gaming Room Software Design Reflection

# 1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, had an existing Android game called Draw It or Lose It, inspired by the 1980s TV show Win, Lose or Draw. They aimed to expand this game into a web-based application accessible across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. Key requirements included supporting multiple teams with unique names, ensuring no duplicate game instances in memory, and maintaining a budget-conscious development process. â€‹


# 2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I effectively translated the client's requirements into a comprehensive software design document. This included detailed system architecture diagrams, domain models, and clear design constraints. The documentation facilitated clear communication between stakeholders and provided a solid foundation for the development team.â€‹


# 3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Creating the design document allowed me to anticipate potential challenges and design decisions before coding began. It served as a roadmap, ensuring that the development process aligned with the client's expectations and that the final product met all specified requirements.â€‹

# 4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revisit the evaluation section to incorporate more detailed testing strategies and performance metrics. Including specific test cases and expected outcomes would provide clearer guidance for the quality assurance process and help ensure the software's reliability across different platforms.â€‹

# 5. How did you interpret the userâ€™s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the userâ€™s needs when designing?
I focused on creating an intuitive user interface that mirrored the original game's experience while enhancing accessibility across platforms. By prioritizing user needs, such as ease of use and seamless gameplay, the design aimed to provide a satisfying experience that would encourage user engagement and retention. Considering user needs is crucial as it directly impacts the software's usability and success in the market.â€‹

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I employed object-oriented design principles and created UML diagrams to visualize system components and their interactions. In future projects, I would continue using these strategies, along with incorporating agile methodologies to allow for iterative development and continuous feedback, ensuring the final product aligns closely with user expectations and requirements.â€‹
